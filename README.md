# What is this?
- Github pages is essentially the "front-end" of the toolkit, and where most users will interact with it.
- This is the "back-end", and a place where contributions from the prospect research and dev community will be added before going live on the website itself
- The toolkit will be a library of resources, tutorials, articles, code, etc. though I have dreams that one day it will have actual homemade software, not just a grab-bag of things. Maybe a package in R or Python, or an extension on Obsidian, or a PowerAutomate UI... and then in the far far future, maybe a standalone application that integrates with free and paid tools.
